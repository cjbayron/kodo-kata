Solutions to programming problems in the wild

## About

Uploaded here are solutions to programming problems I've found in the Internet, shared to me by colleagues, or just anything I'm curious about; meant to hone my programming skills (hence, "kata"), but certainly feels to be just for preventing them to rust :sweat_smile:. Nevertheless, it's fun :grin:.
